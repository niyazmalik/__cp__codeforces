**12:32 AM** : selected 6 problems for today and hopefully I am gonna solve all those (~1000 rated)...
if solved all those then it's gonna be streak of 11 days - 55 problems...thus average of 5 problems per day maintained...

Also today I am gonna start DP as it is very important thing if I want to level up...

**08:28 AM** : still awake...and got some heavy taunts for my looks (particularly my hairs)...No these taunts are not normal ones, these are mixture of curse, abuse, disappointment and more, always tempts me to take bad steps and many times I do...I shout at her, sometimes I have cursed back..But now It's been a while, I am learing to keep myslef in my control..

WOULD BE INTRESTING TO SEE THAT HOW AM I GONNA FEEL WHEN I READ THESE LATER ON...WILL MY FEELINGS CHANGE...WILL MY MINDEST CHANGE? I DON'T THINK SO BUT, IT'S THE "ONLY" CREATOR WHO DECIDES THE MATTER...

Here is my pic of today's morning just after getting some good words from my dear mother....I tried to take it at good angle...and this is what I got...(also didn't wash my face for over 3 days I guess)...

**09:54 PM** : solved 4 problems only...and hopefully I will sleep early and then wake up early tomorrow...BTW listening to S.A.W audio edit...shouldn't be listening to music and I pray for guidance and when I look back into these till then I should have become more patient and controlled man.
