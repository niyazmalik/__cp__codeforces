**05:56 AM** : I didn't sleep for whole night...Now going to get some problems to solve, hopefully solve atleast 3 problems before my eyes give up...

Also I didn't get any taunt yesterday, don't know why my mother's mood was good...I slept whole day as I was awake at night day before yesterday too...

**07:45 PM** : Woke up 1hr ago and solved one more prob and today solved 5 probs...would have solved one good prob more but I'll do that tomorrow...also my efficiency for today is like 20%....maybe I am going to stay awake tonight too and thus my tomorrow's efficiency is also then not going to be that good...But I believe after tomorrow I am going to sleep on time and be more efficient then....... (reason: series?)
